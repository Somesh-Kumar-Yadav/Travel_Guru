We are a learner and this is our third clone so faced many issues to build this site. These are some topic that challenges us to make this:-

- making custom hooks
- using various styling libraries to write less code.
  
## Optimizations

We made this website so much optimized way as compared to the original website we write less no. Of code and more functional.
